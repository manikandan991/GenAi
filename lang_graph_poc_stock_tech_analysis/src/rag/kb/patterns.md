# Chart Patterns & Price Action

## Breakout & Retest
- Close above a recent swing high / trendline with increased volume.
- Preferred entry: **retest** of broken resistance acting as support.

## Pullback in Trend
- In uptrends (SMA50>SMA200), pullbacks toward SMA20/50 can be entries if momentum holds.

## Support & Resistance
- Prior swing highs/lows and moving averages act as S/R.
- Clusters of levels > single lines.

## Risk Management Basics
- Stop just beyond invalidation (e.g., below swing low for longs).
- Risk 0.5%–1% of capital per trade. Avoid adding to losers.
