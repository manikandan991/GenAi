# Core Technical Indicators

## Moving Averages (SMA/EMA)
- SMA20/50/200 used to read trend & dynamic S/R.
- **Golden Cross**: SMA50 > SMA200 (bullish bias). **Death Cross**: SMA50 < SMA200.

## RSI (14)
- >70 overbought, <30 oversold. Divergences (price vs RSI) can foreshadow reversals.

## MACD
- MACD = EMA12 − EMA26; Signal = EMA9 of MACD.
- Bullish when MACD crosses above Signal; bearish when crosses below.

## Bollinger Bands (20, 2)
- Bands widen with volatility; touches at lower band with RSI<35 can hint mean reversion.

## Volume
- Breakouts with rising volume are more reliable.
